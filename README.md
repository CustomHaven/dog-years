# Dog Years

- Dogs mature at a faster rate than humans
- Time Moves quickly for dogs
- For example 8 years in a human life is 45 years for a dog

## Introduction

This is a small project where we will be calculating your dog age in comparison with your age. In other words how old would you be if you were a dog?

- The first 2 years off a dog's life equates to 10.5 dog years
- Then each following year equates to 4 dog years

So instead off doing the calculating in your head we will have the computer do it for you.
